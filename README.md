 ## 🚀 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Repository

Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning algorithms, experiments, and Jupyter notebooks.
This repo is my personal playground for learning, testing, and implementing concepts in ML (and soon DL).

📂 Repository Structure

- *.ipynb → Jupyter notebooks with code + explanations.

- *.py → Python scripts for reusable functions or models.

- data/ → Sample datasets (if small enough).

- models/ → Saved trained models (future).

🧠 Current Topics

- ✅ Classical ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)

- ✅ Hands-on Jupyter notebooks for practice

- ✅ Python implementations of key algorithms

- 🔜 Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, etc.)

⚙️ Requirements

You’ll need Python (≥3.8) and some core libraries. Recommended setup:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Suraj-035/PythonLearn.git
cd your-repo-name
```
